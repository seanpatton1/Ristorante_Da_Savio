                Our journey began with a love for family, tradition, and authentic Italian cooking. Our founder, Savio, grew up in a small village in Italy, learning the secrets of true Italian cooking from his grandmother. Inspired by his passion for plant-based cuisine, Savio decided to reimagine traditional Italian recipes to align with a more sustainable and compassionate approach. Today, we bring those cherished, plant-based recipes to you, ensuring that every meal is both delicious and kind to the planet.
